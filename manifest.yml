description: "This will launch an [RStudio Server] with `module load R`, that is the
  R version installed by the Luca/Pique-Regi group *piquelab*. Please only request
  the resources that you need. There is a 24 hour walltime so your sessions will be
  killed after 24 hours. RStudio can restore to the same point you if you launch again
  so don't worry, but you may lose the last command. Please note that only one session
  will be active, even if you submit more that one of these jobs, you will only have
  one Rstudio session/user. \r\n\r\n[RStudio Server]: https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/\r\n[Wayne
