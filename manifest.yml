description: "This will launch an [RStudio Server] with `module load R`. If you are
  part of Luca/Pique-Regi group *piquelab* that we should use by default. Please only
  request the resources that you need. There is a max walltime so your sessions will
  be killed after that. The session behavior may be different than a standalone RStudio
  server in terms of saving or reconnecting to a session that has been killed.  \r\n\r\n[RStudio
